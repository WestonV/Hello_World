# Hello_World

Hey all!

My name is Weston Verhulst and I'm a sophomore at the mighty fine University of Missouri majoring in Information Technology as well as Business Administration. Currently my strongest programming language is C, however, I'm looking to broaden my programming experience and knowledge through personal projects as well as the Mizzou Computer Association!

I'm trying to familiarize myself with different web applications. I'm not even trying to learn to code, I simply just want to learn how to use Github like a master. as well as other text editors etc. rn i suck at this stuff but you've got to start somewhere
