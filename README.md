# Hello_World

Hey all!

My name is Weston Verhulst and I'm a sophomore at the mighty fine University of Missouri majoring in Information Technology as well as Business Administration. Currently my strongest programming language is C, however, I'm looking to broaden my programming experience and knowledge through personal projects as well as the Mizzou Computer Association!
